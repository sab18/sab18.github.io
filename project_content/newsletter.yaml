  After creating STSW, I thought it would be fun to send out a weekly newsletter to send music recs and keep the people up to date on my life.
method: |
  I send these out via email but what I like about these is that each newsletter is a playground that I can design depending on the week.  Sometimes I put a lot of time into the newsletter and they're creative or even artistc.  Other times, it feels more fitting for them to be to the point and concise.
