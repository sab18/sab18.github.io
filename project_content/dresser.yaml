title: Dresser
date: November 10, 2025
discussion: This was a fun short term project.  I didn't end up making the dresser (for the best) but I learned a lot along the way.  When I designed the first version, I was quite slow.  It was easier for me to delete and redo a shape/dimension if I messed it up than modify it.  I didn't understand dimensioning or what most of the tools did.  By the end, I was using shortcuts and could navigate the platforms much faster.  Another main takeway from this project is using Assemblies in Onshape and mates like slider mate.  Previously I've only ever made 1 main part in CAD, but in this project, I had to make left and right drawers plus the base skeleton.  Having the drawers have functionality wihtin the assembly took some time to understand, but once I was able to get the draws to actually slide, the entire project project came together.  There are still some tolerence issues and minor tweaks I'd make if I was actually going to build this dresser, but I'm happy with how it turned out for the time being.

  I jokingly said I would make my friend a dresser. So, I designed my friend a dresser.

  I used Onshape to do this.<br>

  The first version was a good start.  I modeled it based on the dresser I have in my room.  The drawer mechanism is fairly simple, with a piece of wood at the base of each drawr it slides on.  The downside to this design is that there are a lot of moving parts and the design overall felt clunky and inefficient.  You can see in Fig 1a, 3 pieces of wood are required on the base of the dresser for each drawer slider to function properly.  Another 2 pieces of wood then need to be fastened to the bottom side of the drawer, as shown in Fig 1b.  Needless to say, this was a good first pass at the dresser - it could only go up.<br>

  V2 is giving file cabinet.  Pros - I moved the sliding mechanism to be on the side.  You can see this new design only requires 2 pieces of wood per draw for a nice smooth slide.  There's a bit more work in terms of routing with this version, so the sliders have a slot to mate into, but overall this design is much more simplistic which I like.  I also really worked on getting tolerences to be right here, ensuring the entire dresser is easily modular using variables.  Cons - It's still giving file cabinet.

  In the final version, I mainly made aesthetic changes.  I based the dimensions more on some inspo pics and added hardware for the drawer handles.  At this point, I was quite happy with this as the end product.
