  I went on a week long + camping trip with my best bud earlier this year.  I have a couple different tents (one I got off Amazon in high school for $12, one my mom got from her work's points catolog, and one a friend gave me).  When camping out in Shenandoah, I brought the Coleman my mom gave me - it is nice because it is big and can hold its own, but it's pretty clunky.  It doesn't pack down easily and is really heavy.  After admiring someone with a tent that looked to be extremely light weight, I ideated an idea to make my own tent.
