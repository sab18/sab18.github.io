  I don't really like material stuff (it stresses me out), however, every so often I'll latch onto a possession, and I feel it intertwine with my identity.

  In high school I became a camp counselor and needed to start wearing a watch.  Eventually I bought a Timex Ironman (see Fig1).  It soon became a staple in my life and transcended beyond the summer heat.  I wore this watch every day from 2017 onward.  After the battery died in 2020, I performed some minor surgery and replaced it.  This transplant extended my watch's life for a couple years which brought me joy like no other.  One fateful day, I worked up the courage to go to the beach with a long time pal.  My replacement battery was still going strong, but as doctor in training, I didn't close the stiches properly and my watch's gasket had a sub optimal seal.  Being a good mother, I knew this and avoided water at all costs, but on this day, I looked away for one second and when I realized some water had infected Mr. Timex, it was already too late.  I saw the ink drain out of my watch as the display flatlined.  A moment of silence for my fallen comrade, Fig 2.  Flowers were accepted at the Celebration of Life ceremony.  I mourned but ultimately had to move on, becuase I know that is what my watch would have wanted.<br>

  For a while I was using FitBit hand me downs.  The sleep and heartrate tracking were nice but didn't seem overly accurate.  Eventually I felt ready to graduate to a more professional watch (Fig 3).  To be honest, I've never gotten more compliments on something I've owned before.  I've adopted to this new lifestyle, but a little part of me still misses my old friend.  For years I have tried to find my same colorway online, but Timex doesn't make it anymore.  Perusing the other options, I was left dissatisfied.<br>

  Every once in a while I'd peruse the interwebs in hopes that Timex started manufacturing my favorite dual blue tone blue variation, but at this point I think it's a lost cause.  Eventually, in May 2024, I came across a listing of my exact watch on a website called Bronze Watches.  They sell used and vintage watches, though they don't seem to be a brand anymore.  Of course, I bought it, and reunited with my old friend.  Life was dandy.<br>
  Soon after receiving Mr. Timex 2.0, I wore it on a camping trip.  Unfortunately, the free loop strap gave out and broke so the strap was free to hang which was unwieldy. Essentially, the watch band was so old part of it had petrified.  I put the watch on my closet shelf, where it sat for over a year, until finally I decided to design and 3D print a replacement loop.  The rest of this page outlines that process.<br>

  At the time of designing this watch pieces, I was a complete CAD novice.  After making some rough measurements, I started modeling.  Fig 4a displays my first iteration and its respective print (Fig 4b).

  As is abundently clear, the piece is extremely wide and bulky, and the print quality is sub optimal.  This initial pass was enough to tell me what modifications I should make for round 2.  Moving forward, I tweaked the dimensions of the band - making it slimmer overall.  Fig 5a show the final dimensions of the design.  I used TPU for the actual print rather than PLA, since it is a more flexible material, which is more fitting for a watch loop.  The final print (Fig 5b) came out great and functions as intended.  Once I get back to running, Mr. Timex 2.0 will be a daily .

  This was a good intro project into both CAD and 3D printing.  It was a reminder of how design is an iterative process and filament selection is an important consideration.  In the future, I'd modify the dimentions slightly, namely height of the loops, but overall I'm happy with how this project turned out.  An easy and quick fix to reunite with my beloved companion.
