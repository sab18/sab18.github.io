  My mom was quick to turn my childhood (teenage) bedroom into a secondary living room with a sofa bed.  She wanted a coffee table for the room and instead of buying one, I told her I would make one.  I volunteered to do this bc I had a scrap piece of plywood in my car for 3+ months.  I was intially thinking I would make myself a desk with the plywood, but I already have a desk so I didn't really need a new one.  Fig 1 is the monstrosity of my back seat since summer.  I'm just happy to have my car back to normal.<br>

  This was a farily easy build.  My gameplan going in was that to route the edges of the plywood and stain it.  I toyed with the idea of buying table legs, but ultimately wanted to make them bc it is more of a challenge.  I opted to 3D print the legs since my 3D printer is finally up and running again.  I thought that would be a nicer, more polished look versus my attempt at wooden legs.  Maybe in a future table I'll make legs using a lathe...<br>
  My mom gave me very little direction.  You can see in Fig 2 my initial (v basic) sketches and design.  I thought replicating hairpin legs would be nice, but my iteration of this wasn't easy on the eye.  Plus, (as I was reminded of during this project) my 3D printer has a 12" height capacity and the legs were going to be taller than that.<br>

  I found some simpler legs to base my design off of that made breaking them in half for printing easier.  In thinking about how do cut the legs up, I decided having them screw into each other would be best.  This removes glue from the equation, which is nice, but mostly would teach me a new skill of thread design.  I've done a tiny bit of tapping and dying, but doing this in CAD would be a new adventure to tackle.  My approach was to have the top half of the leg act as the "screw" or threaded rod and the bottom side acts as a nut, where the top portion threads into, as shown in Fig 3.

  In general, I used the Helix tool and swept a triangle around it to make the threads, as shown in Fig 4a.  The key here is to use an equilateral triangle (minus the tip for some addeding tolerence) that has a side length just shy of your helix pitch value.  I used a 1/2" for pitch bc I wanted to have a decently long thread length without having to make a million roations to screw the legs together.  To start, when generating the bottom half, I used a Boolean operator to create the void area the screw would fit nicely into based on the geometry of the top screw.  I printed top and bottom leg pieces out (at full scale), but unshockingly they did not fit together :(.  So it was back to the drawing board.  In my second iteration, I made 2 main changes.  On the bottom nut-adjacent section, instead of a Boolean removal, I used the Helix + equilateral triangle + Sweep trifecta to generate the threads, as shown in Fig 4b.  I also modified the diameter of the threads to be wider so that hopefully the top screw can fit into the bottom threads.<br>

  Fortunately this new design worked and the legs screwed together nicely (Fig 5a + Fig 5b).  I printed all 4 legs out using some tough PLA with a 40% infill and a gyroid filling.  My 3D printing wizard friend said gyroid is strongest and also recommended I increase the filet in some weak points - so I did.  My wizard buddy also said that there is a tool in CAD for making threads, so I didn't need sweep a triangle over a helix at all, but you live and you learn.  Per leg, it took just over a day to print.

  I opted to use __ router bit becuase it would give a nice finish.
