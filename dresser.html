            <h4>Abstract & Background</h4>
            <p>I jokingly said I would make my friend a dresser. So, I made my friend a dresser (in CAD tbf).
</p>
            <div style="height:18px;"></div>
            <h4>Method & Results</h4>
            <p>I used Onshape to do this.  The first version was a good start.  I modeled it based on the dresser I have in my room.  The drawer mechanism is completely wooden, with a small beam at the base of each drawer for it to slide on.  The downside to this design is that there are a lot of moving parts and overall feels clunky and inefficient.  You can see in Fig 1a, 3 pieces of wood are required on the shell of the dresser for each drawer slider to function properly.  Another 2 pieces of wood need to be fastened to the bottom of the drawer to ensure the drawer stays on track, as in Fig 1b.  Needless to say, this was a good first pass at the dresser, and it's only up from here.<br>

<div class="figure-row">
  <figure class="auto-figure" id="fig1a">

  </figure>

      <figcaption>Figure 1b</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

v2 is giving file cabinet.  Pros: I moved the sliding mechanism to be on the side of the drawers.  Fig 2a demonstrates this secondary design requires fewer pieces of wood per draw for a nice smooth slide.  There's a bit more work in terms of routing with this version (Fig 2b), so the drawer can easily mate into and glide on the wooden sliders, but overall this design is much more simplistic which I like.  Cons: it's still giving file cabinet.

    <img src="assets/images/dresser/Fig_2b.png" alt="Dresser view B">
      <figcaption>Figure 2b</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

In the final version, I made significant aesthetic changes.  I based the dimensions on some inspo pics and added hardware for the drawer handles from McMaster.  At this point, I was satisfied with this as the end product.  As shown in Fig 4, the final product looks more dresser-esque and is up to par with its fast furnature competitors.

I worked on the getting the dimensions right quite a bit for this version.  You can see in Fig 4a, my many sketchbook calculations to get proper parametricity.  I was trying to factor in consistent tolerences between all parts which added an extra layer of complexity.

            <h4>Discussion & Learnings</h4>
            <p>This was a fun short term project.  I didn't end up making the dresser (for the best) but I learned a lot along the way.  For starters, setting up project variables to allow for modularity within the design was a necessity and a good practice for all future builds.  Further, the first version was quite slow to design.  It was easier for me to delete and redo a shape if I messed up than modify it.  I didn't understand dimensioning or what most of the tools did.  By the end of v3, I was using shortcuts and could navigate the platform much faster.  I still don't know what all the tools do, but I have much more familiarity with Onshape in general and its capabilities.  Another main learning from this project is using Assemblies.  Previously I've only ever made a single part for a project, but when designing the dresser, I had to make left and right drawers plus the base skeleton.  Piecing everything together made the rendering feel more legitimized and professional looking.  The cherry on top was learning how to use Mates and the Slider Mate Tool to give the drawers real functionality.  Having the drawers actually slide is when the entire project came together in my mind.  There are still some tolerence issues and minor tweaks I'd make if I was actually going to build this dresser, but I'm happy with how it turned out for the time being.  In the future I'd consider using real drawer sliders in place of the current wooden system, but I avoided them for this project to keep costs down.
