            <h4>Abstract & Background</h4>
            <p>I don't really like material stuff (it stresses me out), however, every so often I'll latch onto a possession, and I feel it intertwine with my identity.<br> In high school I became a camp counselor and needed to start wearing a watch.  Eventually I bought a Timex Ironman.  It soon became a staple in my life and transcended beyond the summer heat.  I wore this watch every day from 2017 onward.  After the battery died in 2020, I performed some minor surgery and replaced it.  This transplant extended my watch's life until 2022.  Then, one fateful day, I worked up the courange to go to the beach with a long time pal.  The battery was still going strong, but the doctor didn't close the stiches properly and my watch's gasket was loose.  Being a good mother, I knew this and avoided water at all costs.  For a moment it slipped my mind, and by the time I realized it was too late.  I saw the ink drain out of my watch as the display flatlined.  For a while I was using FitBit hand me downs.  The sleep and heartrate tracking were ncie but didn't seem overly accurate.<br> Eventually I was forced to graduate to a more professional watch [insert].  To be honest, I've never gotten more compliments on something I've owned before.  But a little part of me still misses my old reliable Timex.  The problem was, they didn't sell my favorite color of the watch and all the other color options were not acceptable.<br> I'd peruse the interwebs every once in a while to see if Timex started manufacturing my favorite dual tone blue variation, but they havne't since.  However, I did encounter ___ selling a used version of the watch.  After some deliveration, I bought it.  I reunited with my old friend and life was dandy.<br> Soon after, I wore the watch to a camping trip and the secondary band broke into pieces.  The watch is so old it had petrified.  With a long strap hanging out, I was back to square one.  One day I decided to design and 3D print a replacement strap.  The rest of this page outlines that process.<br></p>
            <h4>Method & Results</h4>
            <p>At the time of designing this watch pieces, I had used CAD a tiny bit, but was far from pro.  The first iteration...second iteration...<br></p>
